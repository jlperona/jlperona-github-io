                 The lines between rooms are valid paths that the algorithm can travel on.
                 Lines that appear to go nowhere, such as the ones on the far right, are 'portals' that travel between floors.

## Background

From 2016 - 2020, I served as a graduate peer adviser in the [Department of Computer Science at UC Davis](https://cs.ucdavis.edu/).
One of my responsibilities in that role was to help with graduate student admissions.

Every year, our program received over 2000 applications.
A significant portion of those were international applicants from countries who do not use the United States' 4.0 GPA scale.
In order to fairly compare with domestic students, their GPAs need to be converted over to the 4.0 GPA scale.
