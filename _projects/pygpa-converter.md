                 The result of running pygpa-converter on the test spreadsheet from the previous picture.
                 For each grade scale (or student in normal usage) pygpa-converter computes the student's 4.0 GPA scale equivalent.

## Background

From 2016 - 2020, I served as a graduate peer adviser in the [Department of Computer Science at UC Davis](https://cs.ucdavis.edu/).
One of my responsibilities in that role was to help with graduate student admissions.

Every year, our program received over 2000 applications.
A significant portion of those were international applicants from countries who do not use the United States' 4.0 GPA scale.
In order to fairly compare with domestic students, their GPAs need to be converted over to the 4.0 GPA scale.
