# jlperona.github.io

Repository for my personal website, hosted with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
You can access it at [perona.dev](https://perona.dev).

## Theme

I use [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).
The website that I've based mine off of, [Aakash Prabhu's personal website](http://aakprabhu.com/), uses [Academic Pages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io).
I'm no longer an academic and don't really need the extra features for Markdown generation.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to [Aakash Prabhu](http://aakprabhu.com/) for the inspiration behind the website layout.
I have made some changes, but my layout generally follows his.

Also, thanks to Michael Papadopoulous for helping me with setting up the hosting.
